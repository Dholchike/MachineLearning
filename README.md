# MachineLearning && Deep Learning work / knowledge / code that ive done . I always wish to learn more and strive for me
I delved into the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning during the lockdown period.
For self projects, I've successfully applied ML models on Breast Cancer datasets etc, Deep Learning models for image classification. 

I've added more of my Machine Learning work in different repositories too 

This is NO WAY AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST of my knowledge or skills or projects that ive done in the field of Machine Learning / Deep Learning .
Im learning more and more day by day and upskilling myself so that i can take up a research internship under professors whose work and interests align with my interests !
